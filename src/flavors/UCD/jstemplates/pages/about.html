<h1>About Bike Philly</h1>
<p>Bikeability is a key component to a great city. <a href="http://www.walkscore.com/walkable-neighborhoods.shtml"><span class="s1">Research</span></a> shows that high walkability translates into healthier, wealthier, cleaner, and more connected communities.</p>
<p>Philadelphia is already considered one of the <a href="http://www.walkscore.com/PA/Philadelphia"><span class="s1">most walkable cities in the country</span></a>, but our great pedestrian access is spotty and not available to all citizens.</p>
<p>This map gives Philadelphians a way of recording and sharing pedestrian obstacles like broken or missing <a href="http://streetswiki.wikispaces.com/Sidewalks"><span class="s1">sidewalks</span></a>, lack of <a href="http://streetswiki.wikispaces.com/Pedestrian+Signal"><span class="s1">crossing signals</span></a>, or an overabundance of <a href="http://streetswiki.wikispaces.com/Parking%2C+Off+Street"><span class="s1">off street parking</span></a> in our communities. By making this information publicly available, we can illustrate areas of greatest need and build support for improvements.</p>
<p>Walk Philly is a demo of Shareabouts, a project from <a href="http://openplans.org/"><span class="s1">OpenPlans</span></a>.</p>
