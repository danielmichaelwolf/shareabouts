<h1>Background</h1>
<p>In an effort to make biking more convenient in University City, the University Bike Collective asks YOU, where do we need more bike racks? The data you share will help determine which locations have the highest demand and will help make a case to get more bike racks on the ground. To learn more about the University Bike Collective and to stay in touch, check us out on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BikeCollectiveU" target="blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BikeCollectiveU" tarket="blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h1>How to Request a Bike Rack</h1>
<p>Click "get started." Click "request a bike rack." Drag the map so the red pin lies above your requested location. Before submitting, you have the option of adding four more pieces of information: 1) a photo, 2) a description, 3) your name, and 4) your email. 1) Adding a photo of a requested location can simply provide a visual context for comments, or it can show how full a rack is or how many bikes are locked to trees/railings/poles (indicators that more racks may be needed) at a given moment. 2) Share as much useful information about this location as you can to help us understand why this location needs more bike parking: Are all racks full? Are there certain times of day when typically full? Is existing bike parking deficient? No racks or poles near an entrance to a building? 3) Sharing your name (first name or full name) will allow your friends to identify your requests in the activity ticker. 4) Add your email to receive future updates on this project.</p>

<h1>Collaborate</h1>
<p>You can also view requests submitted by others and comment on or support their requests. Check out the activity ticker or click on dots on the map to view previous requests, comments, and supports. This site will be up through mid-March, and the more participants we get in this survey, the better, so please help us spread the word and share this link with your friends via email or social media!</p>
